# Loops

# If you want to do something with every item in the list, you can use a for loop
# A variable name follows the for keyword; it will be assigned the value of each list item in turn.
# Then in list_name designates list_name as the list the loop will work on. The line ends with a colon (:) and the indented code that follows it will be executed once per item in the list.

# for variable in list_name:
      # Do stuff!
      
#--------------------------------

my_list = [1,9,3,8,5,7]

for number in my_list:
  # Your code here
  print 2 * number
  
# Each list item is assigned to the user-defined variable number in turn. All you need to do is print two times number in the body of the loop (the indented part).
# The for loop will automatically execute your code as many times as there are items in my_list!

start_list = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]
square_list = []

for x in start_list:
  square_list.append(x ** 2)

square_list.sort() 

print square_list

#--------------------------------

# Dictionary

# A dictionary is similar to a list, but you access values by looking up a key instead of an index. A key can be any string or number. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces, like so:
# d = {'key1' : 1, 'key2' : 2, 'key3' : 3}

# Assigning a dictionary with three key-value pairs to residents:
residents = {'Puffin' : 104, 'Sloth' : 105, 'Burmese Python' : 106}

print residents['Puffin'] # Prints Puffin's room number

# Your code here!
print residents['Sloth'] 
print residents['Burmese Python']

#--------------------------------

menu = {} # Empty dictionary
menu['Chicken Alfredo'] = 14.50 # Adding new key-value pair
print menu['Chicken Alfredo']

# Your code here: Add some dish-price pairs to menu!
menu['Bacon Cheese Burger'] = 10.50 
menu['Pesto Pasta'] = 12.50 
menu['Southern Fried Wrap'] = 14.50 

print "There are " + str(len(menu)) + " items on the menu."
print menu

# key - animal_name : value - location 
zoo_animals = { 'Unicorn' : 'Cotton Candy House',
'Sloth' : 'Rainforest Exhibit',
'Bengal Tiger' : 'Jungle House',
'Atlantic Puffin' : 'Arctic Exhibit',
'Rockhopper Penguin' : 'Arctic Exhibit'}
# A dictionary (or list) declaration may break across multiple lines

# Removing the 'Unicorn' entry. (Unicorns are incredibly expensive.)
del zoo_animals['Unicorn']

# Your code here!
del zoo_animals['Sloth']
del zoo_animals['Bengal Tiger']

zoo_animals['Rockhopper Penguin'] = 'Jungle House'

print zoo_animals

    # New Entries
    # Like Lists, Dictionaries are mutable. This means they can be changed after they are created. One advantage of this is that we can add new key/value pairs to the dictionary after it is created like so:
    # dict_name[new_key] = new_value
    # An empty pair of curly braces {} is an empty dictionary, just like an empty pair of [] is an empty list.
    # The length of a dictionary is the number of key value pairs it has. Each pair counts only once, even if the value is a list. Thatâ€™s right you can put lists inside dictionaries
