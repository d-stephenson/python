# Loops

# If you want to do something with every item in the list, you can use a for loop
# A variable name follows the for keyword; it will be assigned the value of each list item in turn.
# Then in list_name designates list_name as the list the loop will work on. The line ends with a colon (:) and the indented code that follows it will be executed once per item in the list.

# for variable in list_name:
      # Do stuff!
      
#--------------------------------

my_list = [1,9,3,8,5,7]

for number in my_list:
  # Your code here
  print 2 * number
  
# Each list item is assigned to the user-defined variable number in turn. All you need to do is print two times number in the body of the loop (the indented part).
# The for loop will automatically execute your code as many times as there are items in my_list!

start_list = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]
square_list = []

for x in start_list:
  square_list.append(x ** 2)

square_list.sort() 

print square_list

#--------------------------------

# Dictionary

# A dictionary is similar to a list, but you access values by looking up a key instead of an index. A key can be any string or number. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces, like so:
# d = {'key1' : 1, 'key2' : 2, 'key3' : 3}

# Assigning a dictionary with three key-value pairs to residents:
residents = {'Puffin' : 104, 'Sloth' : 105, 'Burmese Python' : 106}

print residents['Puffin'] # Prints Puffin's room number

# Your code here!
print residents['Sloth'] 
print residents['Burmese Python']

#--------------------------------

menu = {} # Empty dictionary
menu['Chicken Alfredo'] = 14.50 # Adding new key-value pair
print menu['Chicken Alfredo']

# Your code here: Add some dish-price pairs to menu!
menu['Bacon Cheese Burger'] = 10.50 
menu['Pesto Pasta'] = 12.50 
menu['Southern Fried Wrap'] = 14.50 

print "There are " + str(len(menu)) + " items on the menu."
print menu

# key - animal_name : value - location 
zoo_animals = { 'Unicorn' : 'Cotton Candy House',
'Sloth' : 'Rainforest Exhibit',
'Bengal Tiger' : 'Jungle House',
'Atlantic Puffin' : 'Arctic Exhibit',
'Rockhopper Penguin' : 'Arctic Exhibit'}
# A dictionary (or list) declaration may break across multiple lines

# Removing the 'Unicorn' entry. (Unicorns are incredibly expensive.)
del zoo_animals['Unicorn']

# Your code here!
del zoo_animals['Sloth']
del zoo_animals['Bengal Tiger']

zoo_animals['Rockhopper Penguin'] = 'Jungle House'

print zoo_animals


# Remove from List

backpack = ['xylophone', 'dagger', 'tent', 'bread loaf']

backpack.remove('dagger')

print backpack

#--------------------------------

my_dict = {
  "fish": ["c", "a", "r", "p"],
  "cash": -4483,
  "luck": "good"
}
print my_dict["fish"][0]

#--------------------------------

inventory = {
  'gold' : 500,
  'pouch' : ['flint', 'twine', 'gemstone'], # Assigned a new list to 'pouch' key
  'backpack' : ['xylophone','dagger', 'bedroll','bread loaf']
}

# Adding a key 'burlap bag' and assigning a list to it
inventory['burlap bag'] = ['apple', 'small ruby', 'three-toed sloth']

# Sorting the list found under the key 'pouch'
inventory['pouch'].sort() 

# Your code here
inventory['pocket'] = ['seashell', 'strange berry','lint']

inventory['backpack'].sort()

inventory['backpack'].remove('dagger')

inventory['gold'] = inventory['gold'] + 50

print inventory

#--------------------------------

# for loops allow us to iterate through all of the elements in a list from the left-most (or zeroth element) to the right-most element. A sample loop would be structured as follows:
    
a = ["List", "of", "some", "sort"]
for x in a: 
  # Do something for every x
  print x 

# This loop will run all of the code in the indented block under the for x in a: statement. The item in the list that is currently being evaluated will be x. So running the following:

for item in [1, 3, 21]: 
  print item

# would print 1, then 3, and then 21. The variable between for and in can be set to any variable name (currently item), but you should be careful to avoid using the word list as a variable, since thatâ€™s a reserved word (that is, it means something special) in the Python language.

names = ["Adam","Alex","Mariah","Martine","Columbus"]

for name in names:
  print name
  
# You can also use a for loop on a dictionary to loop through its keys with the following:

# # A simple dictionary
# d = {"foo" : "bar"}
 
# for key in d: 
#   print d[key]  # prints "bar" 

# Note that dictionaries are unordered, meaning that any time you loop through a dictionary, you will go through every key, but you are not guaranteed to get them in any particular order.

webster = {
  "Aardvark" : "A star of a popular children's cartoon show.",
  "Baa" : "The sound a goat makes.",
  "Carpet": "Goes on the floor.",
  "Dab": "A small amount."
}

for key in webster:
  print webster[key]
